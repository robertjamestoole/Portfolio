# Portfolio
Personal portfolio website built with only HTML/CSS and hosted on netlify

This is strictly a personal website showcasing any interesting projects for potential employers or anyone interested 
in seeing a simply designed website with everything a portfolio needs in my opinion of course.

The website took me forever to make and is my fourth itteration of the site as the last 3 I hated and scrapped before they could see the
light of day, but that is to be expected as this is my first real project and I am learning as I go.

Like I said at the top this site is done entirely using only HTML/CSS/GRID/Flexbox so it is not super complicated or intricate, but that
is more or less what I was going for with a less is more approach.

I am using the netlify form plugin? so all of the forms and spam are dealt with by them and it is a free host for basic users and I
was able to get the domain from them as well. Overall Netlify as a service has been very nice to deal with and the form service makes it
even more worth it as I don't really want to struggle through setting that up the way it is supposed to be done. I am putting off the 
inevitable by doing this but I wanted to get the website up sooner than later and wasn't going to let a form get in the way of that. 
Either it was going to be a form or a 'Contact me' Email, but this felt more interactive and very easy with Netlify.

This is only about my second month learning web development and I am entirely self taught. I know on the website it mentions words like
professional and experienced, but those are more buzz words and not ment to be taken literally for anyone going through the readme that's 
our litle secret.

Either way let me know what you think and how I could improve the site. Although there are a ton of things I still want to implement 
I am proud of this and before I do improve I am going to continue learning JS/React and implement a Gatsby blog website so I can get that 
going instead of posting on Wordpress, where my posts are currently going.

Thanks for any feedback good or bad beforehand.
